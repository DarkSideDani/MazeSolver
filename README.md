# Maze Generator and Solver

Welcome to the Maze Generator and Solver project! This is a Python application built using `tkinter` that generates and solves mazes. It serves as both a fun demonstration of maze algorithms and a useful tool for learning about graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with `tkinter`.

## Features

- **Maze Generation**: Generate mazes using various algorithms.
- **Maze Solving**: Solve the generated mazes using different solving techniques.
- **Graphical Interface**: Interactive GUI built with `tkinter` to visualize the maze and solution.

## Installation

To use this project, you'll need Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/).


### Install Dependencies

No additional dependencies are required beyond Pythonâ€™s standard library for this project. `tkinter` is included with Python, so you don't need to install it separately.
